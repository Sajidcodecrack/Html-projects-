   2=> Ordered list . =====> <ol><li></li></ol>
                             

                          ::::Tables::::
   
     Tables are used to represent real life table data
<tr>  used to display table row 
<td>  used to display table data
<th>  used to display table header 
            
        ::::thread &tbody in tables ::::::

  <thread>==> to wrap table head
  <tbody>==>  to wrap table body 
  <th colspan="n"-> that will take the coloumn span portion area. 
   use for merge like excel sheet 

        :::::: Form in HTML :::::

 Forms are used to collect data from user 
  
Example: Sign up/login/help-request/contact
   
   Action in form::

=> Action attribute is used to define what action needs to be performed when a form is submitted
 <from action="/action.php"> 
          <input type="text" placeholder="Enter anything"/> 
     ****Remember that to developer need to define the value with something that will go in 
  in server database which can easily catch up the information of the user 
    If we give type a password then it will consider maximum password settings
   
             :::: label in Html :::
it works as a fx or swing in java but maximum things are build in function 

   radio Button:: <input type="radio" value="something"name="">value()
  In radio button value and text must try to make similliar beacuse backhend and user dont know where and which information is going 
 to optimize this process making things simmiliar is easier for developer.

     ::: Facilites of label is that if we click on the text then the radio button will also 
    take the inputs 

**********Need to remember that label for and label id must be same otherwise it will not work ********


     ******Check-box******
to select multiple things 
       ***** Text area ******
 A concept that helps the developer to take feedback from user 
      ****Select****
to show the drop downs
       ****** Submit button *****
  A button that will help user to submit their information to the website
           *****iframe tags*****
   ***** Website inside website *****
     <iframe src="link">

   Always remember that when we are working with action attributes need to maintain the 
sequence to connect with the data base so that data base can easily related with the current
user information
